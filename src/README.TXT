Tossed this together to speed-up the creation of allot of SQLite3 
for Java / JDBC recently. These classes will generate the basic C.R.U.D 
operations for a DAO. Schema creation & drop as well.

Demonstration on how to use the package is in main.java.
   Sample output file from same is in SqlTestTable.java.
   The implementation is designed for super-fast growth. 

Thought I would share the package.
